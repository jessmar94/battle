# Battle
Week 3 challenge to build a simple battle game webapp. This Battle part of the project itself is broken up into 15 steps. 

This challenge will help me towards these goals:
- Build a simple web app (this primary goal breaks down into the sub-goals below)
- Follow an effective debugging process for web applications
- Explain the basics of how the web works (e.g. request/response, HTTP, HTML, CSS)
- Explain the MVC pattern

## Action Plan 
More info about the challenge can be found here: https://github.com/makersacademy/course/tree/master/intro_to_the_web 

I paired with someone most days this week. If on one day I paired with someone who was a few steps behind me, I was to start from where they got to.

We broke the project up into the following user stories: 

```bash
As two Players,
So we can play a personalised game of Battle,
We want to Start a fight by entering our Names and seeing them
```
```bash
As Player 1,
So I can see how close I am to winning
I want to see Player 2's Hit Points
```
```bash
As Player 1,
So I can win a game of Battle,
I want to attack Player 2, and I want to get a confirmation
```
```bash
As Player 1,
So I can start to win a game of Battle,
I want my attack to reduce Player 2's HP by 10
```
```bash
As two Players,
So we can continue our game of Battle,
We want to switch turns
```
```bash
As Player 1,
So I can see how close I am to losing,
I want to see my own hit points
```
```bash
As Player 1,
So I can lose a game of Battle,
I want Player 2 to attack me, and I want to get a confirmation
```
```bash
As Player 1,
So I can start to lose a game of Battle,
I want Player 2's attack to reduce my HP by 10
```
```bash
As a Player,
So I can Lose a game of Battle,
I want to see a 'Lose' message if I reach 0HP first
```
## Evidence Plan 
> 01.10.19 feeback from Olly: You get everything really quickly. Pairing with you, going through the challenges together was a smooth ride. You also have a positive attitude, which makes the process enjoyable. You were confident at doing everything required for the challenges and it was enjoyable and fun to work with you. 

> feedback from Nathan Haynes: Smashed it. You had already completed all the code and logic before you were required to. We then just needed to map it correctly in the app. Have more confidence! I had already completed these steps but I barely did anything, you pretty much already finished the challenge and didn't need any guidance from me :) It was great fun to work with you!

## Project Status
- On the Monday, I worked alone through the information steps around HTML and Sinatra. 
- On Day 1 of the challenge, I worked through steps 1-3 on [Olly's repo](https://github.com/ollyholly/Battle).
- On Day 2 of the challenge, I paired with Emily and she was in the process of completing the Sinatra steps so we worked through that together. 
- On Day 3 of the challenge, my pair partner was off so I worked alone through the steps on [my repo](https://github.com/jessmar94/battle). 
- On Day 4 of the challenge, I completed the challenge with Nathan Haynes.
